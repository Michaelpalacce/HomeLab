# Setting up Renovate

Renovate is installed as a Github App and periodically checks my repository for new versions of docker images / helm charts / etc 
and creates Pull Requests with the update.

## Steps:
1. Initial Renovate setup by following the official documentation
2. Follow instructions [here](https://github.com/renovatebot/github-action#special-token-requirements-when-using-the-github-actions-manager)
